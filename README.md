# ScreenShotCoOrdinatesHereMaps
Takes a ScreenShot of Provided Co-Ordinates using Here Maps and Qt

This Project utilises Qt Web Engine for creating a Mini Browser.
One uses the API to pass screen co-ordinates to the Webpage with all
the positions.

It then takes a Screenshot of the Minimum Area that covers them all and saves it in
the Path Specified by the user.

The Points Covered are marked with Icons.

Sample ScreenShot and Position Values are Provided here.

# TODO
Depending upon Project Requirements, provide more abilities to customise the Maps and
The Screenshots
